1-NO. Software engineering focuses solely on software components while software engineering deals with a substantial amount of physical components of computers.

2-Software crisis is a term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. 
The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could now be tackled.
 With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were inadequate.

-Develops information systems by designing, developing, and installing software solutions.
-Determines operational feasibility by evaluating analysis, problem definition, requirements, solution development, and proposed solutions.
-Develops software solutions by studying information needs, conferring with users, and studying systems flow, data usage, and work processes.
-Investigates problem areas.
-Follows the software development lifecycle.
-Documents and demonstrates solutions by developing documentation, flowcharts, layouts, diagrams, charts, code comments and clear code.
-Prepares and installs solutions by determining and designing system specifications, standards, and programming.
-Improves operations by conducting systems analysis and recommending changes in policies and procedures.
-Obtains and licenses software by obtaining required information from vendors, recommending purchases, and testing and approving products.
-Protects operations by keeping information confidential.
-Provides information by collecting, analyzing, and summarizing development and service issues.
-Accomplishes engineering and organization mission by completing related results as needed.

4-True
For explanation I would say: Due to using previously tested components they produce more reliable system at a faster rate.
